  Brief Description:
  </h4>
This WeatherTop application supports the modular weather station called WeatherTop 1000m which
takes a set of meteorological readings and displays these on a simple LCD display. This companion application accepts
user submitted weather reports from their station to the website, capturing readings from the station at a particular
time. This application also generates current + forecast weather readings from an API. The application displays weather analytics for the station.
<br>
<br>
<h4>
Known bugs/problems: 
    </h4>
This version of the application does not adjust for daylight savings in the datetime readings.
<br>
The forecast trend charts only update and display when an autogenerated API weather report is added.
